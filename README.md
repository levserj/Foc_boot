# Foc_boot
Free of charge on SpringBoot

This is a study project, a simple web-app, which is in fact a bulletin board. 
It's designed for the people , willing to contribute their own stuff, which they no longer need,
to someone for free. It can be anything, because all of us has some lockers, depo etc full of
some useless for us things, which we don't use and will throw away as garbage sooner or later.
But maybe someone is desperately looking for exactly the same VHS player we own, and this can make him happier for a moment)
