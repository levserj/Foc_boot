# Foc_boot

Free of charge on SpringBoot 

Nowadays we are living in consumer society in which people often want to get new goods. During our life, all of us gather lots of stuff, some of which we use and some not. Some things become idle because of their age, some are partially broken and some were given to you as a present, but you have no need in them.  It can be anything from VHS movie collection and some plates and dishes, to an old bicycle or clothes that you donâ€™t wear.
FOC is a study project, simple bulletin board, where anyone can post their items, which they no longer need and ready to give to anyone willing to have that item. The only condition is that item should be given for free.
